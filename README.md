# Process Scheduler Simulation

This is a process scheduler simulation program written in C++. It simulates the execution of processes by a computer system with a large memory, one terminal per user, a CPU, and one disk drive. Each process is described by its class (REAL-TIME or INTERACTIVE), start time, and a sequence of resource requests including CPU requests (CPU), disk reads (DISK), and terminal accesses (TTY). Real-time processes have a deadline by which they must complete.

## Features

- Simulates the execution of real-time and interactive processes.
- Tracks CPU and disk utilization.
- Computes statistics such as the number of completed real-time processes, percentage of real-time processes that missed their deadline, number of completed interactive processes, total number of disk accesses, average duration of disk accesses, and total time elapsed since the start of the first process.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Jaswanth19-596/CPUScheduling-Operating-Systems.git
    ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o scheduler
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**
    ```
    ./scheduler < input.txt
    ```

    Replace `input.txt` with the input file containing process descriptions.

4. **View Output:**
    The program will output the simulation results to the console and also save them to an `output.txt` file.

## Input Format

The input file should contain descriptions of processes in the following format:

INTERACTIVE 12000
CPU 100
TTY 5000
CPU 100
DISK 10
CPU 20
REAL-TIME 12000
DEADLINE 13000
CPU 30




- Each line represents a process, starting with its class (INTERACTIVE or REAL-TIME) followed by its start time and sequence of resource requests.

## Output Format

The program outputs the simulation results including the initial and final states of processes, as well as statistics such as the number of completed processes, percentage of real-time processes that missed their deadline, and CPU and disk utilization.
